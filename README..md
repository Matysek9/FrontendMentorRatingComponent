## My process

 I started by creating the template by Vite.
 First i create a card with form to chose selected point.
 After that there was a place to use Hooks, especialy useContext to dynamicly render the content of the site.
 After that i could make the Thanks Card and display the selected value using useContext.
 At the end i realize that using styles.module could be very helpfull because earlier i did't use it and after finishing the Thanks Card i realize it overvrites some styles, so i use styles.module only to the Thanks Card to not rewrite the whole code.

### Built with
 
 React, useState, useContext, useReducer

### What I learned

It was great exercise to train some React and using diferent Hooks.
